description: >-
  A collection holding the Core Blockchain JSON RPC API calls.


  ## Abstract


  Boids created by the current generation of Core clients expose remote procedure call (RPC) methods.


  ## Specification


  ### RFC-2119


  The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).


  ### JSON-RPC


  Communication with Boids is accomplished using [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification), a stateless, lightweight [remote procedure call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) protocol that uses [JSON](http://www.json.org/) as its data format. Core RPC methods MUST be called using [JSON-RPC request objects](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#request_object) and MUST respond with [JSON-RPC response objects](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object).


  ### Error codes


  If an Core RPC method encounters an error, the `error` member included on the response object MUST be an `object` containing a `code` member and descriptive message member. The following list contains all possible error codes and associated messages:


  |Code|Message|Meaning|Category|

  |-|-|-|-|

  |-32700|Parse error|Invalid JSON|standard|

  |-32600|Invalid request|JSON is not a valid request object|standard|

  |-32601|Method not found|Method does not exist|standard|

  |-32602|Invalid params|Invalid method parameters|standard|

  |-32603|Internal error|Internal JSON-RPC error|standard|

  |-32000|Invalid input|Missing or invalid parameters|non-standard|

  |-32001|Resource not found|Requested resource not found|non-standard|

  |-32002|Resource unavailable|Requested resource not available|non-standard|

  |-32003|Transaction rejected|Transaction creation failed|non-standard|

  |-32004|Method not supported|Method is not implemented|non-standard|

  |-32005|Limit exceeded|Request exceeds defined limit|non-standard|

  |-32006|JSON-RPC version not supported|Version of JSON-RPC protocol is not supported|non-standard|
