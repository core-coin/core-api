description: "Generates and returns an estimate of how much energy is necessary
  to allow the transaction to complete. The transaction will not be added to the
  blockchain. Note that the estimate may be significantly more than the amount
  of energy actually used by the transaction, for a variety of reasons including
  CVM mechanics and node performance.\r

  \r

  **Parameters**\r

  \r

  See `xcb_call` parameters, expect that all properties are optional. If no
  energy limit is specified gocore uses the block energy limit from the pending
  block as an upper bound. As a result the returned estimate might not be enough
  to executed the call/transaction when the amount of energy is higher than the
  pending block energy limit.\r

  \r

  **Returns**\r

  \r

  `QUANTITY` - the amount of energy used."
