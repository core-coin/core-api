  **Parameters**\r

  \r

  `QUANTITY` - the filter id.\r

  \r

  ```\r

  params: [\r

  \  \"0x16\" // 22\r

  ]\r

  ```\r

  \r

  **Returns**\r

  \r

  `ARRAY` - Array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed
  since last poll.\r

  \r

  For filters created with `xcb_newBlockFilter` the return are block hashes
  (`DATA`, 32 Bytes), e.g. `[\"0x3454645634534...\"]`.\r

  \r

  For filters created with `xcb_newPendingTransactionFilter` the return are
  transaction hashes (`DATA`, 32 Bytes), e.g. `[\"0x6345343454645...\"]`.\r

  \r

  For filters created with `xcb_newFilter` logs are objects with following
  params:\r

  \r

  `removed`: `TAG` - true when the log was removed, due to a chain
  reorganization. false if its a valid log.\r

  \r

  `logIndex`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the log index position in the block.
  `null` when its pending log.\r

  \r

  `transactionIndex`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the transactions index position
  log was created from. `null` when its pending log.\r

  \r

  `transactionHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the transactions this log was
  created from. `null` when its pending log.\r

  \r

  `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this log was in.
  `null` when its pending. `null` when its pending log.\r

  \r

  `blockNumber`: `QUANTITY` - the block number where this log was in. `null`
  when its pending. `null` when its pending log.\r

  \r

  `address`: `DATA`, 24 Bytes - address from which this log originated.\r

  \r

  `data`: `DATA` - contains one or more 32 Bytes non-indexed arguments of the
  log.\r

  \r

  `topics`: `ARRAY of DATA` - Array of 0 to 4 32 Bytes DATA of indexed log
  arguments. (In Ylem: The first topic is the hash of the signature of the event
  (e.g. `Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)`), except you declared the event with
  the anonymous specifier.)"
