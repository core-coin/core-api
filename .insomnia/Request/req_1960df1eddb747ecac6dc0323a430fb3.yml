description: >-
  The `inspect` inspection property can be queried to list a textual summary of
  all the transactions currently pending for inclusion in the next block(s), as
  well as the ones that are being scheduled for future execution only. This is a
  method specifically tailored to developers to quickly see the transactions in
  the pool and find any potential issues.


  The result is an object with two fields `pending` and `queued`. Each of these fields are associative arrays, in which each entry maps an origin-address to a batch of scheduled transactions. These batches themselves are maps associating nonces with transactions summary strings.


  **Parameters**


  none


  **Returns**


  `OBJECT` - The object with `pending` and `queued` transactions.
